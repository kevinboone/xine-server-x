<h1>File scanner control is not available</h1>

<p>
File scanning and other metainfo-related functions are not 
available, because XSX was started without specifying the
location of an index file. 
</p>

<p>
Use the <code>--index</code> command-line switch, or the
<code>index</code> property in the configuration file, to 
specify an index file. The file need not exist, but it needs
to be in a writable directory. Then select "Full scan" from this page
to begin scanning and building the index.
